Using GCOV with Mongo:

In the mongo SConstruct there was a command --gcov that we could use in order 
to compile the source with the gcov flags set. 

We first made an SConstruct file in Python in our test program in order to 
ensure that we could use the compiler in the same way. 

We used the command:
 scons --gcov --cxx=g++-4.2 --cc=gcc-4.2  
when compiling the files in the mongo directory with gcov on OSX so that scons
would use regular gcc instead of llvm-gcc. 
For linux we would be able to omit the --cxx and --cc flags.
