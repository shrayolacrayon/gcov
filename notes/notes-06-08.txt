Using GCOV with Mongo:

In the mongo SConstruct there was a command --gcov that we could use in order 
to compile the source with the gcov flags set. 

We first made an SConstruct file in Python in our test program in order to 
ensure that we could use the compiler in the same way. 

We used the command:
 scons --gcov --cxx=g++-4.2 --cc=gcc-4.2  
when compiling the files in the mongo directory with gcov on OSX so that scons
would use regular gcc instead of llvm-gcc. 
For linux we would be able to omit the --cxx and --cc flags.

Once everything was compiled, we started mongod and ran firstExample, 
secondExample, clientTest, and whereExample to generate some .gcda files.

We then generated html output using the following commands

	lcov -c -d build/darwin/cc_gcc-4.2/cxx_g++-4.2/gcov/ -b . -o build/mongodb.info
	genhtml build/mongodb.info -o build/html
	
Creating this file and opening the index.html file gave results that were 
basically a list of the different programs run and then results on the branch 
and function coverage. 

For each file, there is an html page which details how many times each line, 
branch, or function was run. For branches, hovering over the + or - signs on
the left will show how many times either branch was taken.
