In the latest commits to the master branch, support has been added for building 
mongodb with gcov flags. You can do this with the following command.

	scons --gcov

Be careful when building on the latest versions of OSX, since the gcc packaged 
with XCode now is llvm-gcc, which does not have gcov support. Make sure to 
install regular gcc and pass the correct compiler to scons using the --cxx flag.

Once the code is compiled, you should see a bunch of .gcno files created in the 
build directory. You can then run any tests you want to run and .gcda files will 
be created in the build directory. To generate a tracefile from this data
run the following command

	buildscripts/lcov/runlcov.sh build/path/to/gcov

where the first argument is the build directory in which the .gcda files were
created. This program will create a tracefile in build/mongodb-`date +%s`.info.
Each run of runlcov.sh will produce a different tracefile.

You can generate html from a tracefile using the following command

	genhtml tracefile.info -o html

where html is the directory in which the html files will be placed.

If you want to see information from separate tests, you can use 

	find build/path/to/gcov -name \*.gcda -exec rm {} \;

to clear out the gcda files in between tests, so that you will get fresh
results instead of accumulated ones. 

If you want to merge the tracefiles from several different tests into one 
tracefile, use the following command. 

	lcov -a tracefile1.info -a tracefile2.info ... -o aggregate.info
