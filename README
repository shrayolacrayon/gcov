Compiling C and C++ files with gcov support

To compile C and C++ files to support lcov pass the flags 
	-ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs
to gcc. Make sure you do this in both the compilation and the linking stage.

Note for Mac OSX users. The gcc provided by the latest versions of xcode now
use the LLVM backend, and therefore do not support gcov output. In order to 
use mainline gcc, install gcc from https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer

Running lcov and generating html output. 
After compiling and running your executables, you should now have a bunch of 
.gcda files alongside your source files. At this point, you can generate
a summary of all the .gcda files in the current directory using by running 

	lcov -c -d . -o infofile.info

Where infofile.info is the name of the file you want to print out the summary
data to. Once you've done this, you can generate html fo the summary data by
running 

	genhtml infofile.info -o html

Where infofile.info is the info file to generate html for and html is the 
directory you want the html files to be outputted to. You can now view the
html summary by opening html/index.html in your web browser.
