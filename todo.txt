1. Test program - 200 lines of code, branches 
2. Research on GCov
- 
- Mongos Test Suite- output of GCov
3. Tools Related to GCov
4. Visualization of the data 

Notes June 7, 2012
- Made a test program that added all even numbers between 1 and 10000, and also 
  did a recursive Euclid's algorithm in order to have an amount of branches. 
- Got gcov to run using gcc-4.2. The gcc installed by XCode is using the llvm 
  backend, so it doesn't support gcov.
- The data goes into a text file so we would either need to parse through the 
  file in order to get information needed or figure out a different interface.
- lcov

- We figured out how to do one source file, but we need to do multiple source files:
	- Consolidate multiple sources files into one html page
